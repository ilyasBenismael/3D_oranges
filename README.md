# üçä On-Tree Citrus Fruit Sizing via 3D Reconstruction

Accurately estimating fruit size is essential in precision agriculture for **yield prediction and quality control**.  
Traditional sensor-based or manual methods are either **expensive** or **impractical at scale**, while RGB-based approaches offer a **low-cost and easily deployable alternative** using just consumer smartphones.  

This repository presents a **complete RGB-based 3D reconstruction pipeline** designed for **on-tree fruit sizing**.  
Each component of the pipeline ‚Äî from segmentation to metric scaling and geometric fitting ‚Äî was carefully selected and experimentally validated to identify the most **robust and accurate 3D reconstruction methods** under orchard conditions.

The pipeline follows a structured, end-to-end process:

1. **Video Capture** ‚Äì short RGB video of the tree containing fruits and a known-size reference object  
2. **Frame Extraction** ‚Äì sharp frames are selected from the video  
3. **2D Segmentation** ‚Äì fruits detected using *GroundingDINO* and segmented with *Segment Anything (SAM)*  
4. **3D Reconstruction** ‚Äì scene reconstructed via *SfM*, *PatchMatch-MVS*, or neural methods (*3DGS*, *SuGaR*)  
5. **Metric Scaling** ‚Äì reconstruction scaled to real-world units using the reference object  
6. **Clustering and Fitting** ‚Äì fruits isolated with *HDBSCAN*, then sphere fitting used to estimate diameters  
7. **Final Output** ‚Äì fruit diameters in millimeters with visual and quantitative evaluation
